IN RPGs, players have points to spend on their character attributes. Create a function that returns the total number of points players have spent on their characters. The function will receive a map containing the strength, dexterity, and intelligence values. Each point in strength should be multiplied by two, and dexterity and intelligence should be multiplied by three.
